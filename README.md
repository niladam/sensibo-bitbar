# Sensibo QuickControl Bitbar Plugin

### This plugin provides a quick access to your [Sensibo](https://sensibo.com/) Pods. The plugin requires [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) and obviously, [Bitbar](https://getbitbar.com/).

An API key is required in order for this plugin to function. Your API key can be set using the **API_KEY** variable inside the plugin and you're good to go.

And because i know that an image is worth a thousand words, here's how it looks in your menubar:

</p>

The plugin automatically lists all your available PODS with the option to turn/schedule them on or off.

The data currently shown:

 - status [ <strong>ON :white_check_mark: / OFF :red_circle:</strong> ]
 - current temperature <strong>25.3 &deg;C / F</strong> (whichever is set) (starting from **1.2.1** the Fahrenheit is correctly displayed thanks to [@RobertD502](https://github.com/RobertD502))
 - humidity [ <strong>ðŸ’§ 43.5%</strong> ]
 - swing [ <strong>stopped</strong> ]
 - fan level [ <strong>auto</strong> ]
